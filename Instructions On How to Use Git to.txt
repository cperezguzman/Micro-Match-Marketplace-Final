// Instructions On How to Use Git to Develop DB Final Project App
# 1. Make sure you are on main and up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create a development branch (from main) and switch to it
git checkout -b dev
git push -u origin dev

# Now you have main (stable) and dev (integration) branches

# 3. Whenever you start a new feature, create a feature branch based on dev
git checkout dev
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name         # e.g. feature/profile-page

# 4. Work on your feature: edit files, add, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add profile page and related components"

# 5. Push your feature branch to remote (so it’s backed up / shareable)
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# 6. When feature is done and tested, switch back to dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev     # get latest changes in dev (if any)
git merge feature/your-feature-name   # merge feature branch into dev
git push origin dev

# 7. Once several features in dev are stable and tested, merge dev into main
git checkout main
git pull origin main    # ensure main is up-to-date
git merge dev
git push origin main
